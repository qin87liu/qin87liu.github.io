      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Vader was born Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine. He attended the Jedi Academy on Coruscant, where he majored in the Force and studied under Jedi Knight Obiwan Kenobi. During his training he married Padme Amidala, a member of the Galactic Senate. Padme unfortunately passed away giving birth to twins, during which time Anakin converted to the Dark Side and was given the name Darth Vader. Vader now works directly for his Sith Master Darth Sidious aka Emperor Palaptine. In his spare time Vader enjoys piloting Tie Fighters and searching the galaxy for his son.
