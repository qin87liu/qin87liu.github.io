      <h1>Profikio</h1>
      <p>Connecting teachers with the support they need.</p>
      <h2>What is Profikio?</h2>
      <p>
        Profikio is an online marketplace that connects 6th-12th grade teachers with teaching assistants to grade and provide feedback on student assignments.

        <p>
          Many teachers constantly feel overwhelmed with the number of tasks they are responsible for each day. These include planning lessons and units, classroom prep, managing students in the classroom, grading, parent outreach, and various administrative tasks. As a result, teachers are unable to focus on any particular aspect of their practice, such as planning innovative lessons for their students.
        </p>

        <p>
          Profikio supports overwhelmed teachers by matching them with Teaching Assistants, typically students majoring in education, to help  grade student work. Profikio will allow teachers to identify the best TA (by subject, availability, and rating) that can grade an assignment and give students in-depth feedback within 1-3 days. This allows teachers to focus on other activities that impact their performance in the classroom, while also providing them with meaningful data on student progress.

        <p>
          Graduate and undergraduate students majoring in education but not yet student teaching might be interested in helping teachers, while simultaneously gaining exposure to real student work and assignments in their subject area. Not to mention extra income!
