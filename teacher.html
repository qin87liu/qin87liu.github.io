    <h1>Why should teachers use this service?</h1>
    <p>
      By having teaching assistants helping to grade student work, teachers will have more time to dedicate to other tasks such as producing innovative lesson plans or providing tutoring to struggling students. Using teaching assistants also means faster turn-around time on grading and more data on student understanding of material, which teachers can then use to improve their instruction.
