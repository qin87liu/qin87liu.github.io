        <p>Profikio eases the burden of grading. Teachers can focus on other aspects of their practice.</p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        We believe that teachers are the key to improving public education in the US. Most teachers have the passion and the ability to make a significant impact on their students, but many are held back by the sheer number of tasks they are responsible for each day. 
      </p>
      
      <h2>Our Solution</h2>
      <p>
         Profikio supports teachers by matching them with Teaching Assistants, typically students majoring in education, to help  grade student work. Profikio will allow teachers to identify the best TA (by subject, availability, and rating) that can grade an assignment and give students in-depth feedback within 1-3 days. This allows teachers to focus on other activities that impact their performance in the classroom, while also providing them with meaningful data on student progress.
